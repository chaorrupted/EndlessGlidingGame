# EndlessGlidingGame
Source code for a mobile gliding game made in Unity. Soar through the skies, bounce off of the trampolines to keep gliding for longer.

# Features
- Slingshot-launch the character with various speeds.
- Glide graciously or fall down with gravity.
- Bounce off of trampolines to keep flying forever.
- Level will be generated endlessly as you fly forwards.
  - Previous level segments you left behind will be reused.

# Controls
Tap and drag your finger left to adjust slingshot power. Release finger to launch. Then tap anywhere and hold to glide, and drag to steer left/right while gliding.

# how to run the game:
You'll want to create some required gameobjects and prefabs and arrange the scene as described in this section to be able to build/play the game. You should be able to make out which script goes where and which serialize field is assigned where with some trial and error. Or, you may or may not be able to contact me and ask and I may or may not be able to help you.

You'll also want to discard the meta files included in this repository and let your unity create it's own meta files.
